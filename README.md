Week 6: MakersBNB (AirBNB Clone)

## Intro
We were tasked to create an AirBNB clone in a week. This was our first group work task
## Challenges
One challenge we faced was adjusting to group work after a long period of pair programming. I feel we tried to approach it in
the same way as a pair but we soon found out that there was a need for some form of leadership & management as we had 
different skill levels but no central driver of direction. Growing from this experience, I always make a concious effort
to coach other team members in things I have proficiency in. 
This way we can all develop our technical skills while still having a great product.
